used the temporal Light kitbash for tilesets as well as generic sprites
https://timespacewarrior.itch.io/temporal-light-kitbash
I am also using kenny assets for the background tilesets only and used sparingly

plugins used
master volume plugin for web versions
https://github.com/Y0UR-U5ERNAME/gbs-plugin-collection

prepare menu is a plugin created for temporal light and creates a drawable window at the bottom of the screen and was in every temporal light game since shadow flame

Assets used(in depth)
anything used unless otherwise stated means that they where modified some majorly as only the body type is the same some is the outfit is different.
any game in parenthesis unles has "NTL" in front means a game from the temporal light series

the hud is based on the prior games but was recreated from scratch

pearlite's spritemap was used as a template for kitsune characters. each one given their own unique sprite (game origin:jem of twilight)

emma's spritemap was used as a base for a side character sina buttface(yes that is their name) (game origin:dark foundation)

peryil's spritemap was used as a base for a side character flame (game origin:shadow flame)

flare's spritemap was raceswapped and used as a base for slice and bias (game origin:jem of twilight)

braught over the game over screen from jem of twilight and did changes such as centering the text and adding elements

using gb studio mono as a base individually changed the letters for TL_magiscript (used for a ancient magic that can be obtained in a later chapter)(orign:NTL-GB-studio default)

using jem's status screen from jem of twilight and inspiration from shadow flame the screen was altered to fit the new mechanics(Game origin:Jem of Twilight)

grass furret sprite was taken from dark foundation (Game Origin:Dark Foundation)

the intro cutscene and hyperion war theme was used for the FPS section. the sprites however where recreated for first person perspective (game origin:Hyperion War)
