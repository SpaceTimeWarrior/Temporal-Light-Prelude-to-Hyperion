I am also using kenny assets for the background tilesets only
plugins used
master volume plugin for web versions

prepare menu created for temporal light but creates a drawable window at the bottom of the screen and was in every temporal light game since shadow flame

the hud is based on the prior games but was recreated from scratch

anything used unless otherwise stated means that they where modified some majorly as only the body type is the same some is the outfit is different

pearlite's spritemap was used as a template for kitsune characters. each one given their own unique sprite

emma's spritemap was used as a base for a side character sina buttface(yes that is their name)

peryil's spritemap was used as a base for a side character flame

flare's spritemap(jem of twilight) was raceswapped and used as a base for slice and bias

braught over the game over screen from jem of twilight and did changes such as centering the text and adding elements

using gb studio mono as a base individually changed the letters for TL_magiscript (used for a ancient magic that can be obtained in a later chapter)

using jem's status screen from jem of twilight and inspiration from shadow flame the screen was altered to fit the new mechanics

grass furret sprite was taken from TL:dark foundation
