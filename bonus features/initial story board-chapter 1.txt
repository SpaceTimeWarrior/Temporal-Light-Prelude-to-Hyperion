chapter 1
April 5th 2004
appalachin mountains, south carolina (later distortion mountains)

the game starts with a tv brodcast of the president of the united states over to the new Earth order
the brodcast is interupted by blair's sister glacia yelling to get packed for school
glacia: Blair you are watching tv again we have to go to school
the screen then changes to blair's room (it looks like a stereotypical girl's room in the early 2000's with  first generation of 3d printer in the bottom right corner)
blair is sitting in front of the tv
she gets up
system:press <>^*[* is down in game's font] to move

once the player leaves the room
next scene(glacia is talking to kit[glacier's and blair's mother] in a kitchen. and glaicia notices blair and glacia starts to walk to blair and the camera focuses on glacia as she walks toward blair)
once glacia gets close to blair

Glacia: thought I find you watching tv another drama video or a horror film

blair: worse news.

glacia gives a confused look: news what is going on
kit then walks into the scene

blair: our president signed over the us to the new Earth order
everyone except blair gives shocked looks

glacia: are you sure it wasn't one of those apocolipse films where a planet or multiple are being destroyed by some sort of giant creature

kit: I am not completely suprised as the us was the last big country that hasn't already signed their country over to the new Earth Order

blair: if it is it is a movie it was very convincing but it could of been a propaganda ad as I just turned it on.

kit: I will ask at work but you two should get to school

glacia and blair then leave the house to the garage
and each gets on a motorcycle and put on a headset then a helmet

glacia: we will take the backroads it is a nice practice of our shooting skills

the scene changes to a dirt path with blair riding a motorcycle with glacia a little further ahead 

glacia:I will go ahead to clear a path. but press select on your bike to select a magic type and press @[internal for the a button] to fire.(internal tutorial)

blair: is there a reason for reciting the manual to me. are you going to tell me the oiling schedule next

glacia: no reason...ok maybe to anoy you.

the player navigates a path of trees and fallen branches
most of which are frozen and shattered.


chapter 2
once the player reaches glacia both jem and glacia get on the road and enters the school parking lot

blair then takes her helmet off and places them in the lockbox on the motorcycle
